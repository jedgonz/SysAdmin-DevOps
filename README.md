# SysAdmin-DevOps
This repository's main purpose is to organize notes and scripts about every day and/or general sysadmin/devops stuff.  

As sysadmin/devops engineer we are always working with data.  Whether your main job may be maintaing hundreds or perhaps thousands of servers as an SRE or working as a security analyst, you will spend the better part of the day collecting, analyzing, browsing, transforming data that is constantly being generated by those systems or processes that you are responsible for.   With such much data on the wire, what do you do to make sense 

This data that you collect may come from a log file, or data that you obtain from scripting some API; these days the one thing that we will encounter the most is data in JSON format.  I will be exploring the use of some tools that every sysadmin/devops should be using on a daily basis to process this JSON data and gain better insight and help you further automate your environment.  Here is a list of some of the tools that we will be exploring:

XSV<br>
